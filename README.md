# user-proximity-service

## Functional Requirements
- Generate user location entries 
- Generate user location update requests
- Perform user proximity queries (give nearby users of user X within N meters/kilometers)
- Select search algorithm implementations on UI
- Perform parameterized variables (search distance, N of users in the system, user location update frequency, e.g. update user location every minute/every 10 sec/etc.)  

## Purpose
- Experiment with system design to achieve maximum system performance
- Research different approaches and database solutions
